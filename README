About
=====

The treasurer is a small python script that queries a running instance of the
gnome keyring daemon for a password identified by a user provided hint.

Since the treasurer is meant to be run inside scripts (to prevent having plain
passwords scattered all over your config files) with no access to a terminal, it
communicates problems via libnotify.

This scenario leads to the treasurer being unable to ask for a password to
unlock a keyring via STDIN. This means that if it encounters a locked keyring,
it will present you with a GTK dialog asking for the key to the 'ring. No
offense meant. It just was the easiest solution.
