About
=====

The treasurer is a small python script that queries a running instance of the
gnome keyring daemon for a password identified by a user provided hint.

Since the treasurer is meant to be run inside scripts (to prevent having plain
passwords scattered all over your config files) with no access to a terminal, it
communicates problems via libnotify.

This scenario leads to the treasurer being unable to ask for a password to
unlock a keyring via STDIN. This means that if it encounters a locked keyring,
it will present you with a GTK dialog asking for the key to the 'ring. No
offense meant. It just was the easiest solution.


Features
========

 * Headless operation for execution in scripts:
   * Notifications via libnotify
   * Asks for passwords to locked keyrings via a GTK dialog
 * Keyring selection
 * List all hints in the selected keyring
 * Fuzzy keyrings: Specification of a unique prefix suffices
 * Lock keyring after query
 * Invalidate passwords (to locked keyrings and read from the same) in memory
   when no longer needed


Install
=======

I would like to recommend installing the treasurer locally.
For this purpose, a simple

    $ python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME/.local

should do the job nicely.


Usage
=====

$ treasurer --help
usage: treasurer [-h] [-k KEYRING] [-l] hint

positional arguments:
  hint                  the identifier of the sought-after password

  -k KEYRING, --keyring KEYRING
                        the keyring that is to be searched for the password
  -l, --lock            lock the keyring after the query
