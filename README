About
=====

The treasurer is a small python script that queries a running instance of the
gnome keyring daemon for a password identified by a user provided hint.

Since the treasurer is meant to be run inside scripts (to prevent having plain
passwords scattered all over your config files) with no access to a terminal, it
communicates problems via libnotify.

This scenario leads to the treasurer being unable to ask for a password to
unlock a keyring via STDIN. This means that until there is a (potentially GUI)
solution to that problem, you painfully have to make sure that all keyrings your
scripts want to access are unlocked. Seahorse can help you with it, but it still
is a very manual action.
