About
=====

The treasurer is a small python script that queries a running instance of the
gnome keyring daemon for a password identified by a user provided hint.

Since the treasurer is meant to be run inside scripts (to prevent having plain
passwords scattered all over your config files) with no access to a terminal, it
communicates problems via libnotify.

So far, the treasurer only supports password retrieval from the gnome keyring
daemon's default 'login' keyring. This can easily be changed and is simply due
to the fact that
 1. GDM only unlocks the default keyring upon login of a user (provided the
    other requirements are fulfilled)
 2. there is no GUI to unlock a locked keyring yet 


Usage

$ treasurer
USAGE: $ treasurer <password hint>
